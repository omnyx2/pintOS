# Easy setup codes
I made a Easy setup code that you can run pintOS in VMware(version 16), ubuntu(14.04.6)
It could be work more higher version of ubuntu. you can try the auto setup code from here.
However it has possiblity to not work properly on above version.


## USEAGE
1. Edit the first line which is `admin_name=ryuhyunseok`. As your root user name(admin_name)
2. Copy and paste the code to terminal of ubuntu. It will start once after install pintOS
3. Go to your pintOS directroy
`cd /home/$admin_name/pintos/src/threads && pintos -q run alarm-multiple	`
4. Enjoy easy setup pintOS
